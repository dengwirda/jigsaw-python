`JIGSAW` is an unstructured mesh generator and tessellation library; designed to generate high-quality triangulations and polyhedral decompositions of general planar, surface and volumetric domains. 

`JIGSAW` includes refinement-based algorithms for constructing new meshes, optimisation-driven techniques for improving existing grids, as well as routines to assemble (restricted) Delaunay tessellations, Voronoi complexes and Power diagrams.

This package provides a <a href="http://www.python.org">`Python`</a> based scripting interface to the underlying `JIGSAW` mesh generator, including a range of additional facilities for file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing operations.

`JIGSAW` has been compiled and tested on various `64-bit` `Linux` , `Windows` and `Mac` based platforms. 

### `Quickstart`

    Ensure you have a c++ compiler and the cmake utility installed.
    Clone/download + unpack this repository.
    python3 build.py
    pip3 install .
    python3 example.py --IDnumber=0
    
Note: installation of `JIGSAW` requires a `c++` compiler and the `cmake` utility.
    
### `Function Listing`

See `jigsawpy` for a description of the various functions available.

    build.py    - compile and install JIGSAW's c++ backend using cmake.
    example.py  - a list of demo programs. 
    
    jigsaw.py   - cmd-line interface to JIGSAW's backend
    libsaw.py   - api-lib. interface to JIGSAW's backend
    
    loadmsh.py  - load *.msh files.
    savemsh.py  - save *.msh files.
    loadjig.py  - load *.jig files.
    savejig.py  - save *.jig files.

    project.py  - apply cartographic projection operators to mesh obj.

    bisect.py   - refine a mesh obj. via bisection.
    extrude.py  - create a mesh obj. via extrusion.

### `Example Problems`

The following set of example problems are available in `example.py`:

    example: 0; # simple 2-dim. examples to get started
    example: 1; # simple 3-dim. examples to get started
    example: 2; # frontal-delaunay methods in the plane
    example: 3; # frontal-delaunay methods for surfaces
    example: 4; # frontal-delaunay methods for volumes
    example: 5; # user-defined mesh-spacing constraints
    example: 6; # dealing with sharp-features in piecewise smooth domains
    example: 7; # dealing with sharp-features in piecewise smooth domains
    example: 8; # (re)mesh marching-cubes style outputs
    example: 9; # creating prismatic volumes via extrusion

Run `python3 example.py --IDnumber=N` to call the `N-th` example. `*.vtk` output is saved to `../cache` and can be visualised with, for example, <a href=https://www.paraview.org/>Paraview</a>.
